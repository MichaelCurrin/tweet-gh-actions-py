## About

- This is a template project - get a copy and then customize it for your needs.
- This project can post a tweet to your Twitter account using a cloud runner on GitHub.
- It runs using [GitHub Actions](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-resources/resources/ci-cd/github-actions/) and a manual trigger - [Workflow dispatch](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-cheatsheets/cheatsheets/ci-cd/github-actions/triggers.html#workflow-dispatch). See [tweet.yml](/.github/workflows/tweet.yml) workflow file.
- The flow does **not** rely on any Actions which are specialized around Twitter. Rather this uses a generic Python action and your own logic, so it is more flexible (you can query the API want however you want) and does not depend on a specialist library which might get forgotten and not maintained by the owner one day.
- This comes with a short Python script - [tweet.py](/tweepy.py), which is the app run my the workflow.
- Twitter API keys must be generated by the repo owner and stored securely in GitHub Actions' Secrets (to avoid abuse) and these get used privately on the server side of the workflow (so no one else on GitHub or looking at the log can see your credentials).


## Disclaimer

Tweeting using API requests and some code actually requires _registering_ a dev account and dev app on Twitter.

See my [Twitter policies](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/python-twitter-guide/#/policies) guide for more info.


## Use-cases
> How you could use this project

- Tweet your GitHub repo URL or website URL on a deploy (like a merge to master or a release is created).
- Generate a random tweet message from a file of possible messages and tweet it daily.
- Just for fun, enter a message directly in GitHub Actions (though you're limited on the input which only accepts a single line of input - unless you adapted the Python script to convert `"\n"` text into an actual line break).
- Copy the code to run somewhere else. Like on your web server, a Lambda, an automated task or a manual script. Just avoid running tweet logic on a frontend (like with JS) and you'd unsafely expose your credentials, while running server side is fine.


## Sample usage
> How to run the GitHub Actions workflow manually to create a tweet

_Note: Only administrators of this repo can run the workflow. But the Actions logs are public if you want to see the history of runs._

Click _Run workflow_ button on the right:

<img src="/docs/_media/workflow-1.png" alt="Workflow screenshot" width="600" />

Enter your message:

<img src="/docs/_media/workflow-2.png" alt="Workflow screenshot" width="400" />

Check the output in the log:

<img src="/docs/_media/workflow-3.png" alt="Workflow screenshot" width="600" />

View the profile on Twitter and see the new tweet added:

<img src="/docs/_media/created-tweet.png" alt="Tweet screenshot" width="500" />


## Start tweeting from your own repo

Only an admin user of ths repo can Tweet using it. But if you copy this repo to your own account and have Twitter API credentials at hand, you can start tweeting with GitHub too.

Get a copy of this project:

<div align="center">

[![Use this template](https://img.shields.io/badge/Generate-Use_this_template-2ea44f?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/tweet-gh-actions-py/generate "Create repo from template")

</div>

Next, customize the secrets on GitHub as per the [docs](/docs).

Then run the workflow on GitHub to post a tweet using text that you enter.

### Customize

You can customize this project with your own logic. 

Such as to generate a random message, based on a text file of possible messages.

You could make the workflow run daily by setting up a [Schedule](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-cheatsheets/cheatsheets/ci-cd/github-actions/triggers.html#trigger-on-a-schedule) trigger.

Or you could tweet whenever you deploy or create a GitHub release. Though, if you are adding tweeting logic to an existing project, then instead of using this project, you might want to use a tweet-related Action from the [GitHub Actions marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace). Which means you just need a few lines in a workflow and don't need a whole Python script.
